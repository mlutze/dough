Critical Hits Revisited

Presented here are optional rules that expand the
scope of critical hits in D&D 5e. Introducing a series of
critical hit charts that vary based on the damage type
of the attack, Critical Hits Revisited can be included in
a campaign to add an additional element of uncertainty,
suspense, and surprise to combat. DMs and players
may also be interested in utilizing Critical Hits Revisited
to increase the consequence of engaging in combat,
including the potential for death or dismemberment.

Revisions to Critical Hits
Except when noted otherwise below, use the normal
rules for critical hits.
• When you land a critical hit on a creature, instead
of rolling the attack’s damage dice twice and adding
them together, roll a d20 and use the corresponding
result on the critical hit chart determined by the
damage type of your attack.
• When you score a critical hit with an attack that does
two or more types of damage, choose one of those
damage types and roll on that critical chart.
• The Half-Orc Savage Attacks trait and the Barbarian
Brutal Critical feature continue to work as written.

Bludgeoning
You call that a crit? Roll damage as normal.
Smashed off balance! Roll damage as normal and
the next attack against the creature has advantage.
Good hit! Do not roll your damage dice, instead
deal the maximum result possible with those dice.
Sent reeling! Do not roll your damage dice,
instead deal the maximum result possible with
those dice and push the creature up to 15 feet in
any direction.
Great hit! Roll your damage dice twice and add
them together.
Take a seat! Roll damage dice twice and add them
together and the creature is knocked prone.
Rocked and rolled! Roll damage dice twice and
add them together, push the creature up to 15 feet
away, and the creature is knocked prone.
Grievous injury! Deal the maximum amount of
damage from your normal damage dice then roll
your damage dice and add the result. Then roll on
the Minor Injury chart. If the creature is wearing
heavy armor roll on the Major Injury chart instead.
Crushed! Deal the twice maximum result of your
damage dice and roll on the major injury chart.
Splat! Deal the maximum result of your damage
dice twice, the creature is stunned until the end of
your next turn, and roll on the major injury chart.

Alternate Option: Selective Use of Critical Hits
When you implement the rules presented in Critical Hits
Revisited the lives of the player characters gets a lot
harder. Some players will love it, some will hate it, and
some will be perfectly fine with it until the day they get
one-shot by a kobold.
If you and your players prefer, the normal critical hit
rules can be used for monsters of low significance to
the story or who are not meant to be a life threatening
combat for the player characters. Using this alternative
rules player characters continue to use the critical
hit charts when they deal damage but creatures only
roll on the critical hit charts when they have dramatic
importance to the story and / or are meant to a
potentially lethal encounter for the characters

Injuries & Insanity
Critical hits can cause minor and major injuries. When
a creature suffers a minor injury it can be healed by the
spell lesser restoration or by using the recuperating
downtime activity (Player’s Handbook, pg. 187).
Major injuries will not heal on their own and
require the powerful healing spell, greater restoration.
Insanities, caused by critical hits that deal psychic
damage, must be healed the same way.
The text of certain injuries will specify other ways
this injuries might resolve. For example, the Blow to
the Head! minor injury resolves after the 2d12 hours
time period has elapsed while the Decapitated! major
injury cannot be healed through the use of the greater
restoration spell.
